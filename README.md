# SoundSolver

SoundSolver is a web app that enables users to perform calculations using voice input. Users can speak out mathematical expressions, and the app will evaluate and display the result in real-time.

## Overview

SoundSolver leverages speech recognition technology to convert voice input into text, which is then evaluated as a mathematical expression. The app provides a simple and intuitive way to perform calculations without typing.

## Features

### Voice Input

- **Speech Recognition**: Users can activate voice input by clicking on the "Start Listening" button. The app uses browser-based speech recognition to capture voice commands.

### Real-time Calculation

- **Instant Evaluation**: As users speak out a mathematical expression, SoundSolver evaluates it in real-time and displays the result immediately.

### Error Handling

- **Invalid Expression**: The app handles invalid expressions gracefully and displays an error message to the user.

## How it Works

1. **Activate Voice Input**: Click on the "Start Listening" button to activate voice input.
  
2. **Speak Mathematical Expressions**: Speak out the mathematical expression you want to calculate (e.g., "two plus three", "four times five", "square root of sixteen").

3. **View the Result**: The app will evaluate the expression and display the result on the screen.

## Example Commands

- Addition: "two plus three" ➡️ 5
- Subtraction: "ten minus five" ➡️ 5
- Multiplication: "four times five" ➡️ 20
- Division: "ten divided by two" ➡️ 5
- Square Root: "square root of sixteen" ➡️ 4
